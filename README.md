# Project: camelCase

# camelCase is a murder mystery game made in Unity. The user plays as a camel detective. He is tasked to interact with 8 different
# characters that are stopped in a train car after a murder has occured to discover who is guilty. After talking to each character, 
# more information about how they are linked to the victim appears on a "cards" page.
# The game also has a start screen, cut scene (video animation), and end screen

# This is only the code. Nothing from the rest of the Unity project is included here.
